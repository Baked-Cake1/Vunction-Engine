# Hello!

A new project here! Just finished development. This is a Powershell-powered antimalware. It's very straightforward but it's only a scanner for now. I might plan on adding Real-Time Protection. This is only a basic project for now. *Vunction Engine* was originally a VirusTotal engine, which was used to automate making comments on the maliciousness of a certain file on the platform, now it's evolved into a ***real*** project and I'm proud of it.

# Next update in...
**2 hours (Update 2.1, MAJOR UPDATE, might be delayed)**

# New update includes...
* Scanning the whole PC (could take around 30 minutes)
* Scanning memory first **if scanning the whole PC.**
* Updated lists and got rid of the old, outdated one.
* Added more lists - about 6 from the internet of malware hashes from MalwareBazaar and others.
* Includes a reason on why the file is malicious (in beta, it'll just say 'Malicious' from a bug)
* Much more easier to run.
